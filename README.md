CSS Units &amp; Selector Experiment

Create a page simply to experiment in applying advanced CSS selectors such as:

1. comma
2. space
3. >
4. :

Additionally, try experimenting with V units (vh, vw, vmin, and vmax).

As a technical exercise, this page can just be boxes, text, colors, and placeholder content. If you would like to give it a subject, or make it an art piece, please feel free!
